% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Pedestrian detection targets to classify and localize multiple people and return the spatial location of each person from images and videos.  Though after 30 years of research, many works achieved remarkable results on object detection, most of detectors are not ideal for pedestrian detection in crowded scenes. One reason is that the majority of training datasets only label the uncovered parts of objects which make occluded features hard to be learned. Moreover, most monocular detectors do not take into consideration the multi-camera geometry to resolve ambiguities and ignore occlusions. In this work, we present a model to apply multi-view detection based on monocular instance segmentation using CNNs and multi-view geometry to localize, which is intended to detect people in crowded scenes. This report shows the usage of pedestrian detection, the challenge for detection, the proposed methodology, and its performance on the terrace video sequences.

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed

% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{P}{edestrian} detection targets to classify and localize multiple people from images and videos, which is a long-standing problem in computer vision. It has a vast range of applications which can be directly applied in the field of real-world tasks, such as vehicle-assisted driving system, intelligent
video surveillance and robots.

Vision-based pedestrian detection technology has been developed over decades, most of them rely on learning algorithms to find the implicit representation of people. There are two difficulties in the design of pedestrian detection system of finding precise features of pedestrians.

\subsubsection{Inconstant appearance}

Pedestrians’ appearance varies because of the change in height, pose, sex, clothing and accessory. 
\subsubsection{Occlusion}

Pedestrians are moving objects who may be occluded by other objects, especially the occlusion among pedestrians in crowded scenes.


Detecting pedestrians through multiple cameras within an overlapping field of view, allowing to merge more spatial information, is a reasonable solution for occlusion. This work use homography transformation to fuse information of potential location of pedestrians in a top view to indicate their positions in all camera views



This work's contribution is: a simple method to apply current state-of-art deep learning detection technology in multi-view detection which is pre-trained by a monocular dataset and provide a more robust detection compared with methods using background subtraction, HOG and SVM.
\section{Related work}
The traditional paradigms before 2010 were based on variants of  feature extraction techniques: HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) and DPM (Deformable Parts Model). HOG extracts features relied on the edge and shape, like color contrast between pedestrians and background, so it is not effectively record the visible information of objects and it is sensitive to noise. As regards the other method, DPM is more advanced, but it need to manually define features and it is not robust to detect objects with rotating, stretching, and changing the visual angle.

Monocular detection works based on CNN, such as YOLO series and RCNN series have made remarkable achievement on COCO dateset, since deep convolutional neural networks are highly robust to lights, color, texture and white balance, and normally have richer dimensional representations of features computed over the input. However, most multi-view detection methods still depends on old and outmoded technologies, because CNNs rely heavily on training datasets enabling researchers to apply multi-view training on pedestrian detection, but they do not exist.

\section{Method for Merging Monocular Detector}
The overview of our method is shown as\ref{fig:overview1}, it takes two inputs from a monocular detector: masks(foregrounds of pedestrians) and bounding boxes. The truncated mid-lines of bounding boxes are then projected to a top view, where the pedestrians' location candidates are defined. Next RSS (Repulsive Spatial Sparsity Filtering) find local peaks and reduces the duplicates.

\subsection{Candidates Proposal}

\subsubsection{Homography}

One difficulty of monocular detection is finding the exact foot positions of pedestrians. The middle bottom point of each bounding box (specifically generated by Mask RCNN in this work) is not the centroid between feet. By default, for eliminating ambiguities, each mid-line of a bounding box is truncated and projected to the top view by homography.
A scanner, the horizontal orange line with two gray ends, scans whether it is an occlusion between objects. If either of two ends intersects with the foreground (segmentation), the mid-line should be extended until there is no intersection between the scanner and foreground.

One difficulty of monocular detection is finding the exact foot positions of pedestrians. The middle bottom point of each bounding box (specifically generated by Mask RCNN in this work) is normally not the exact pedestrians' positions. By default, to eliminate ambiguities and find the real positions of pedestrians, each mid-line of a bounding box is truncated, extended and projected to the top view.

A scanner, the horizontal orange line with two gray ends, scans whether it is an occlusion between objects. If either of two ends of a line intersects with the foreground (segmentation), the truncated mid-line will be extended until there is no intersection between the scanner and foreground.

\subsubsection{Candidates Types}
After setting the length of truncation, the mid-lines are projected from all views to a top view, then the next is to propose potential pedestrian's location on ground.
There are three types of candidates which locate the potential positions. First type is the intersection of projected lines, it aims to find the ground centroid  position of pedestrians.
Second type is a set of points between to non-intersected lines, it aims to prevent missed detection while the object is detected by opposite angles.
Third type it a set of points on a line who have no neighbors within a specific range, it aims to provide candidates for the person at the edge of overlapping field, where the object is only detected by a signal camera.

\subsection{Multi-view Mask Scoring}
Occlusion can become a serious problem in complex scenarios with multiple  targets. The score generated by Mask RCNN aims to assess classification results, which is not well correlated with multi-view detection and it can not be used for disambiguate ghost detection.

A likelihood function is applying to candidates after inverse projecting them to camera views and generating numbers of N (N stands for the number of camera views) corresponding bounding boxes based on their positions on the top view. It is assumed the width of a bounding box is 37.5\% its height in this step.

The likelihood function is defined as 
$$
    S_{\text {total}}=\sqrt[n]{\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(S_{h e a d}[k]*S_{f o o t}[k]\right)}
$$
Where n stands for the number of cameras who detect a same pedestrian by a monocular detector. Since it is hard to know whether bounding boxes frames a same target across multiple views,so  that n is counted by the number of valid re-projected bounding boxes (A valid bonding box should be in its corresponding camera's field of view) for a candidate. 
\subsubsection{S$_{\textbf{head}}$}
$S_{head}$ aims to measure the horizontal deviation of a bounding box, whose range is from $0.2$ to $1.0$.

\begin{equation*}
    S_{h e a d}=\frac{\sum h i s t[i] \cdot y[i]+\sum \left | hist[i] \cdot y[i]\right|}{2 \sum \left | hist[i] \cdot y[i]\right|} 
    \label{eq:Shead}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{$hist$}
The masks are binary images whose values are either $1$ or $-1$ (if the original masks values are $1$ and $0$, change all $0$ to $-1$)

$$
    mask[i][j]=\left\{\begin{array}{l}{1}\rightarrow 1 \\ {0}\rightarrow -1\end{array}\right.
$$

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig/800th_mask.png}
    \caption{Masks: 800th frame of terrace dataset, view 1 to view 4}
    \label{fig:800th_mask}
\end{figure}

Then count pixel values and add them vertically by every column in the bounding boxes generated from candidates, which are points in the top view. 

$$
hist=\left[\sum_{i=b}^{t}{mask}[i][0] \ldots \sum_{i=b}^{t}{mask}[i][col]\right]
$$

Where $b$ is the bottom raw of bounding box and $t$ is the top raw of it.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{fig/800th_hist.png}
    \caption{Histogram of mask column by column: A ideal bounding box should have positive values in the middle and negative on both sides}
    \label{fig:800th_hist}
\end{figure}

The drawback of $S_{head}$ is that , when faced with occlusion problem, the bounding box often has higher response in the middle of two targets, because there are more foreground pixels, so that $hist$ has larger positive value, but . Therefore, $y[i]$ in \eqref{eq:Shead} should twist $hist$ values to correct this problem. An ideal bounding box is supposed to be located at the center of target and bound other targets as less as possible.

$S_{foot}$ aims to measure the vertical deviation at foot.
The cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution is used to measure how far is it from foot to bottom of the respective bounding box. Also, to punish low-confidence candidates generated by the inappropriate truncated length of mid-lines, overlap ratio in one-fifth of the bounding box(lower part) between foreground(segmentation) and bounding box area is multiplied with $S_{foot}$.
$$
    \begin{aligned} S_{f o o t} &=2 * C D F\left(f o o t-B o t t o m, \sigma^{2}\right) * \text { Overlap Ratio} \\ &=\frac{2}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\text {foot}-B o x B o t t o m} \exp \left(-\frac{t^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right) d t \\ & * \frac{\sum_{i=-\frac{w}{2}}^{\frac{w}{2}} \sum_{j=bottom}^{\frac{height}{5}} \text { foreground }[i, j]}{w * h} \end{aligned}
$$
\subsection{Soft Region Non Maximum Suppression}
NMS (Non Maximum Suppression) is widely used in object detection for clean up the predictions , but it is also one of reasons that cause difficulties in dense object detection. NMS pick out local maximum recursively and eliminate unnecessary predictions based on IOU of bounding boxes. It is a rash method that make wrong execution.

To enhance the ability for detection in crowded scene, we proposed a non maximum suppression variant that not only use IOU but also take advantage of the geometric information. That is to say, the positions on the top view are helpful to improve NMS performance under occlusion between same class targets.
